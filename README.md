# Business Site
This is a responsive business website created as part of a bootcamp project. The website is designed for a fictional concert venue, "Concert House," with a focus on user registration, mobile-friendly navigation, and layout.
This project serves as a practical exercise in HTML and CSS, emphasizing responsive design, accessibility, and user interaction.

# The Problem
The goal was to create a simple, user-friendly platform where visitors can sign up for membership and enjoy special offers. The design was built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the layout adapts well across devices. Key challenges faced during development include:

Image and layout adjustments: Ensuring that images and layout components scale well across different screen sizes, especially for mobile users.

# Next Steps
Improve mobile navigation: Ensure the hamburger menu works seamlessly, and add functionality to expand/collapse the navigation on mobile and tablet devices.
Optimize the registration form: Improve form styling and validation to make the user experience smoother.
Accessibility: Ensuring the website is fully accessible to all users.

# Key Features:
Responsive Layout: The site adapts to various screen sizes using CSS media queries, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Membership Registration Form: Users can sign up for membership by providing personal information and agreeing to terms and conditions.
Footer with Contact Information: Includes a link to the developer's LinkedIn profile for easy contact.

# Technologies Used:
